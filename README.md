## Hi there 👋

I’m a **Cloud Solutions Architect at Microsoft**, working at the intersection of **cloud**, **AI**, and **DevSecOps**.

I spend a lot of time exploring how **AI** can enhance modern cloud systems — not just for innovation’s sake, but to create solutions that are reliable, maintainable, and compliant in real-world environments.

If any of that resonates or you’d like to connect, you can find me on
